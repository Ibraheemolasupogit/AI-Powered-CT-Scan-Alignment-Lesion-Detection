# üß† AI-Powered CT Scan Alignment & Lesion Detection

This 12-week research project explores the use of AI and computer vision to assist radiologists in comparing CT scans over time ‚Äî enabling earlier detection, diagnosis, and tracking of lesions (tissue growth).

---

## ü©∫ Project Goal

To automate the comparison of two CT scans taken at different times, by: 
- Aligning scan slices for accurate visual comparison
- Detecting and measuring changes in lesions or organs
- Highlighting areas of concern to assist clinical decision-making

## üî¨ Key Components

### 1. **Scan Alignment**
- Explored multiple 2D and 3D alignment methods:
  - **Phase correlation** for shift detection
  - **Keypoint-based methods** and **Coherent Point Drift** for non-rigid alignment

### 2. **Lesion Detection & Measurement**
- Developed unsupervised and self-supervised anomaly detection techniques:
  - **Masked data prediction** models
  - **DINO (Vision Transformers)** for tissue segmentation
- Used classical techniques like:
  - **Textons + Mean Shift clustering** for explainable segmentation
  - **3D ellipsoid detection** to locate lesion-like regions

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Methods

- Computer Vision (OpenCV, scikit-image)
- Unsupervised Deep Learning (DINO, masked autoencoders)
- Image Registration Techniques
- Classical ML (Mean Shift, clustering, segmentation)

---

## üìå Outcome

This project demonstrates a pipeline that can:
- Align CT scans taken on different dates
- Detect visual anomalies in 2D and 3D
- Segment tissue and measure lesion volumes

It aims to reduce the manual effort required by radiologists, while improving consistency in longitudinal imaging comparisons.
